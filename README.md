Covid-19 Pandemic will shut down large parts of the world economy and COVID-19 similar to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, have been affected to the trading, cultivation and feeding of many Indians. So we need to cultivate agricultural products for our needs, and nowadays lots of people have been developed an interest in cultivation, but current generation lack enough knowledge about conventional & modern form of agriculture, such as planting, harvesting, fertilizers used for it etc..
The AgriArchive Project aims connecting the Agricultural sector with digital world, for enabling the next generation with the farming techniques and solution for the challenges faced by them.  I implement CURD operation for adding, updating, deleting details about the items, and sign up, login, logout button, contact us page also along with it. And I like to add a shopping cart with my app for purchasing seeds.Every one can access home and crops page,and Login User can access the shopping page.Only Admin can have the rights to adding, updating, deleting operations. Both user/admin can login through the same login page.
The AgriArchive Project helps newcomers for cultivation in agricultural sector.
